# GTK-C++ example using cppgir and object introspection

This is an example of gtk c++ project created using cppgir project.
The export of interface is included in this project for now. The idea
is to test how can work and how can be used to write software without
using gtkmm. This is not a replacement of gtkmm but a proof of concept.
